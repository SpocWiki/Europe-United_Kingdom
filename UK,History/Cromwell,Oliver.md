> Oliver Cromwell (25 April 1599 – 3 September 1658) was an English statesman, politician and soldier, 
> widely regarded as one of the most important figures in British history. 
> 
> He came to prominence during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, 
> initially as a senior commander in the Parliamentarian army and latterly as a politician. 
> 
> A leading advocate of the execution of Charles I in January 1649, 
> which led to the establishment of the Commonwealth of England, 
> Cromwell ruled as Lord Protector from December 1653 until his death 1658.
>
> Although elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdon in 1628, 
> much of Cromwell's life prior to 1640 was marked by financial and personal failure. 
> 
> He briefly contemplated emigration to [[New England]], 
> but became a religious Independent in the 1630s 
> and thereafter believed his successes were the result of divine providence. 
> 
> In 1640 he was returned as MP for Cambridge in the Short and Long Parliaments. 
> He joined the Parliamentarian army when the First English Civil War began in August 1642 and quickly demonstrated his military abilities. In 1645 he was appointed commander of the New Model Army cavalry under Thomas Fairfax, and played a key role in winning the English Civil War.
>
> The death of Charles I and exile of his son Charles, followed by military victories in Ireland and in Scotland, firmly established the Commonwealth and Cromwell's dominance of the new regime. In December 1653 he was named Lord Protector, a position he retained until his death, when he was succeeded by his son Richard, whose weakness led to a power vacuum. This culminated in the 1660 Stuart Restoration, after which Cromwell's body was removed from Westminster Abbey and re-hanged at Tyburn on 30 January 1661. His head was cut off and displayed on the roof of Westminster Hall. It remained there until at least 1684.
>
> The debate over his historical reputation continues. He remains a controversial figure due to his use of military force to acquire and retain political power, his role in the execution of Charles I and the brutality of his 1649 campaign in Ireland. Winston Churchill described Cromwell as a military dictator, while others view him a hero of liberty. 
>
> His statue outside the Houses of Parliament, first proposed in 1856, was not erected until 1895, with most of the funds privately supplied by Prime Minister Archibald Primrose.
