> The history of the United Kingdom begins in 1707 with the Treaty of Union and Acts of Union. 
> The core of the United Kingdom as a unified state came into being 
> with the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland, 
> into a new unitary state called Great Britain. 
> 
> Of this new state, the historian Simon Schama said:
> What began as a hostile merger would end in a full partnership 
> in the most powerful going concern in the world... 
> it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.
>
> The first decades were marked by Jacobite risings 
> which ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. 
> 
> In 1763, victory in the Seven Years' War led to the growth of the First British Empire. 
> With defeat by the US, France and Spain in the War of American Independence, 
> Great Britain lost its 13 American colonies 
> and rebuilt a Second British Empire based in Asia and Africa. 
> 
> As a result, British culture, and its technological, political, constitutional, 
> and linguistic influence, became worldwide. 
> 
> Politically the central event was the French Revolution 
> and its Napoleonic aftermath from 1793 to 1815, which British elites saw as a profound threat, 
> and worked energetically to form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. 
> 
> The Acts of Union 1800 added the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
>
> The Tories, who came to power in 1783, remained in power until 1830. 
> 
> Forces of reform opened decades of political reform that broadened the ballot, 
> and opened the economy to free trade. 
> 
> The outstanding political leaders of the 19th century included 
> Palmerston, Disraeli, Gladstone, and Salisbury. 
> 
> Culturally, the Victorian era was a time of prosperity and dominant middle-class virtues 
> when Britain dominated the world economy 
> and maintained a generally peaceful century from 1815 to 1914. 
> 
> The First World War, with Britain in alliance with France, Russia and the US, 
> was a furious but ultimately successful total war with Germany. 
> 
> The resulting League of Nations was a favourite project in Interwar Britain. 
> 
> In 1922, 26 counties of Ireland seceded to become the Irish Free State; 
> a day later, Northern Ireland seceded from the Free State and returned to the United Kingdom. 
> 
> In 1927, the United Kingdom changed its formal title 
> to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
> usually shortened to Britain, United Kingdom or UK. 
> 
> While the Empire remained strong, as did the London financial markets, 
> the British industrial base began to slip behind Germany and the US. 
> 
> Sentiments for peace were so strong 
> that the nation supported appeasement of Hitler's Germany in the 1930s, 
> until the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 started the Second World War. 
> 
> In the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the US joined the UK as the main Allied powers.
>
> After the war, Britain was no longer a military or economic superpower, 
> as seen in the Suez Crisis of 1956. 
> 
> Britain granted independence to almost all its possessions. 
> 
> The new states typically joined the Commonwealth of Nations. 
> 
> The postwar years saw great hardships, 
> alleviated somewhat by large-scale financial aid from the US. 
> Prosperity returned in the 1950s. 
> 
> Meanwhile, from 1945 to 1950, the Labour Party built a welfare state, 
> nationalised many industries, and created the National Health Service. 
> 
> The UK took a strong stand against Communist expansion after 1945, 
> playing a major role in the Cold War and the formation of NATO as an anti-Soviet military alliance 
> with West Germany, France, the US, Italy, Canada and smaller countries. 
> 
> The UK has been a leading member of the United Nations since its founding, 
> as well as other international organisations. 
> 
> In the 1990s, neoliberalism led to the privatisation of nationalised industries 
> and significant deregulation of business affairs. 
> 
> London's status as a world financial hub grew. 
> Since the 1990s, large-scale devolution movements in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales 
> have decentralised political decision-making. 
> 
> Britain has moved back and forth on its economic relationships with Western Europe. 
> It joined the European Economic Community in 1973, 
> thereby weakening economic ties with its Commonwealth. 
> 
> However, the Brexit referendum in 2016 committed the UK to leave the European Union, 
> which it did in 2020.
