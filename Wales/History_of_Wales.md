> The history of what is now Wales (Welsh: Cymru) 
> begins with evidence of a Neanderthal presence from at least 230,000 years ago, 
> while Homo sapiens arrived by about 31,000 BC. 
> 
> However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period 
> after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, 
> and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age. 
> 
> During the Iron Age, as in all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, the culture had become Celtic, 
> with a common Brittonic language. 
> 
> The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, 
> first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, 
> and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79. 
> 
> The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, leaving it for the Anglo-Saxon settlement. 
> Thereafter, the culture began to splinter into a number of kingdoms. 
> The Welsh people formed with English encroachment 
> that effectively separated them from the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples in the early middle ages.
>
> In the post-Roman period, a number of Welsh kingdoms formed in present-day Wales, 
> including Gwynedd, Powys, Ceredigion, Dyfed, Brycheiniog, Ergyng, Morgannwg, and Gwent. 
> 
> While some rulers extended their control over other Welsh territories and into western England, 
> none were able to unite Wales for long.  
> 
> Internecine struggles and external pressure from the English, 
> and later the Norman conquerors of England, 
> led to the Welsh kingdoms coming gradually under the sway of the English crown. 
> 
> In 1282, the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 
> led to the conquest of the Principality of Wales by King Edward I of England; 
> since then, the heir apparent to the English monarch has borne the title "Prince of Wales". 
> The Welsh launched several revolts against English rule, 
> the last significant one being that led by Owain Glyndŵr in the early 15th century. 
> In the 16th century Henry VIII, himself of Welsh extraction as a great-grandson of Owen Tudor, 
> passed the Laws in Wales Acts aiming to fully incorporate Wales into the Kingdom of England.
>
> Wales became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 
> and then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. 
> Yet, the Welsh retained their language and culture despite heavy English dominance. 
> 
> The publication of the extremely significant first complete Welsh translation of the Bible 
> by William Morgan in 1588 greatly advanced the position of Welsh as a literary language. 
> 
> The 18th century saw the beginnings of two changes that would greatly affect Wales: 
> the Welsh Methodist revival, which led the country to turn increasingly nonconformist in religion, 
> and the Industrial Revolution. 
> 
> During the rise of the British Empire, 19th century Southeast Wales in particular 
> experienced rapid industrialisation and a dramatic rise in population 
> as a result of the explosion of the coal and iron industries. 
> 
> Wales played a full and willing role in the First World War. 
> The industries of the Empire in Wales declined in the 20th century 
> with the end of the British Empire following the Second World War, 
> while nationalist sentiment and interest in self-determination rose. 
> 
> The Labour Party replaced the Liberal Party as the dominant political force in the 1920s. 
> 
> Wales played a considerable role during the Second World War, 
> along with the rest of the United Kingdom and its allies, 
> and its cities were bombed extensively during the Blitz. 
> 
> The nationalist party Plaid Cymru gained momentum from the 1960s. 
> In a 1997 referendum, Welsh voters approved the devolution of governmental responsibility 
> to a National Assembly for Wales which first met in 1999, 
> and was renamed as the Welsh Parliament in English and Senedd Cymru in Welsh in May 2020.
