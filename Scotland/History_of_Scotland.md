> The recorded history of Scotland begins with the arrival of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, 
> when the province of Britannia reached as far north as the Antonine Wall. 
> 
> Before Roman times, prehistoric Scotland entered the Neolithic Era about 4000 BC, 
> the Bronze Age about 2000 BC, and the Iron Age around 700 BC.
>
> North of this was Caledonia, inhabited by the Picti, 
> whose uprisings forced Rome's legions back to Hadrian's Wall. 
> As Rome finally withdrew from Britain, a Gaelic tribe from Ireland called 
> the Scoti began colonising Western Scotland and Wales. 
> 
> The Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata was founded on the west coast of Scotland in the 6th century. 
> In the following century, Irish missionaries introduced the previously pagan Picts 
> to Celtic Christianity. 
> 
> Following England's Gregorian mission, 
> the Pictish king Nechtan chose to abolish most Celtic practices in favour of the Roman rite, 
> restricting Gaelic influence on his kingdom and avoiding war with Anglian Northumbria. 
> 
> Towards the end of the 8th century, the Viking invasions began, 
> forcing the Picts and Gaels to cease their historic hostility to each other 
> and to unite in the 9th century, forming the Kingdom of Scotland.
>
> The Kingdom of Scotland was united under the House of Alpin, 
> whose members fought among each other during frequent disputed successions. 
> The last Alpin king, Malcolm II, died without a male issue in the early 11th century 
> and the kingdom passed through his daughter's son to the House of Dunkeld or Canmore. 
> 
> The last Dunkeld king, Alexander III, died in 1286. 
> He left only his infant granddaughter, Margaret, as heir, who died herself four years later. 
> England, under Edward I, would take advantage of this questioned succession 
> to launch a series of conquests, resulting in the Wars of Scottish Independence, 
> as Scotland passed back and forth between the House of Balliol and the House of Bruce 
> through the late Middle Ages. 
> 
> Scotland's ultimate victory confirmed Scotland as a fully independent and sovereign kingdom.
>
> In 1707, the Kingdom of Scotland united with the Kingdom of England 
> to create the new state of the Kingdom of Great Britain under the terms of the Treaty of Union. 
> 
> The Parliament of Scotland was subsumed into the newly created Parliament of Great Britain 
> which was located in London, 
> with 45 Members of Parliament (MPs) representing Scottish affairs in the newly created parliament. 
>
> In 1999, a Scottish Parliament was reconvened 
> and a Scottish Government re–established under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998, 
> with Donald Dewar leading the first Scottish Government since 1707, until his death in 2000. 
> 
> In 2007, the Scottish National Party (SNP) were elected to government following the 2007 election, 
> with first minister Alex Salmond 
> holding a referendum on Scotland regaining its independence from the United Kingdom. 
> Held on 18 September 2014, 55% of the electorate voted 
> to remain a country of the United Kingdom, with 45% voting for independence.
>
> During the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, 
> Scotland became one of the commercial, intellectual and industrial powerhouses of Europe. 
> 
> Later, its industrial decline following the Second World War was particularly acute. 
> Today, 5,490,100 people live in Scotland, 
> the majority of which are located in the central belt of the country 
> in towns and cities such as Ayr, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paisley and Kilmarnock, 
> and cities such as Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness to the north of the country. 
> 
> The economy has shifted from a heavy industry driven economy 
> to be become one which is services and skills based, 
> with Scottish Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimated to be worth £218 billion in 2023, 
> including offshore activity such as North Sea oil extraction.
