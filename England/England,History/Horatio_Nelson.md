> Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, 1st Duke of Bronte 
> (29 September [O.S. 18 September] 1758 – 21 October 1805) 
> was a Royal Navy officer whose leadership, grasp of strategy and unconventional tactics 
> brought about a number of decisive British naval victories 
> during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. 
> He is widely regarded as one of the greatest naval commanders in history.
>
> Nelson was born into a moderately prosperous Norfolk family 
> and joined the navy through the influence of his uncle, Maurice Suckling, 
> a high-ranking naval officer. 
> 
> Nelson rose rapidly through the ranks and served with leading naval commanders of the period 
> before obtaining his own command at the age of 20, in 1778. 
> He developed a reputation for personal valour and a firm grasp of tactics, 
> but suffered periods of illness and unemployment 
> after the end of the American War of Independence. 
> 
> The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars allowed Nelson to return to service, 
> where he was particularly active in the Mediterranean Sea. 
> He fought in several minor engagements off Toulon and was important in the capture of Corsica, 
> where he was wounded and partially lost sight in one eye, 
> and subsequently performed diplomatic duties with the Italian states. 
> 
> In 1797 he distinguished himself while in command of HMS Captain 
> at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. 
> 
> Shortly after that battle, Nelson took part in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, 
> where the attack failed and he lost his right arm, forcing him to return to England to recuperate. 
> The following year he won a decisive victory over the French at the Battle of the Nile 
> and remained in the Mediterranean to support the Kingdom of Naples against a French invasion.
>
> In 1801, Nelson was dispatched to the Baltic Sea 
> and defeated neutral Denmark at the Battle of Copenhagen. 
> 
> He commanded the blockade of the French and Spanish fleets at Toulon 
> and, after their escape, chased them to the West Indies and back 
> but failed to bring them to battle. 
> 
> After a brief return to England, he took over the Cádiz blockade in 1805. 
> On 21 October 1805, the Franco-Spanish fleet came out of port, 
> and Nelson's fleet engaged them at the Battle of Trafalgar. 
> 
> The battle became one of Britain's greatest naval victories, 
> but Nelson, aboard HMS Victory, was fatally wounded by a French marksman. 
> His body was brought back to England, where he was accorded a state funeral, and considered a hero.
>
> Nelson's death at Trafalgar secured his position as one of Britain's most heroic figures. 
> His signal just prior to the commencement of the battle, 
> "England expects that every man will do his duty", is regularly quoted and paraphrased. 
> Numerous monuments, including Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London, 
> and the Nelson Monument in Edinburgh, have been created in his memory.
