## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The House of Plantagenet (plan-TAJ-in-it) was a royal house 
> which originated in the French county of Anjou. 
> The name Plantagenet is used by modern historians to identify four distinct royal houses: 
> - the Angevins, who were also counts of Anjou; 
> - the main line of the Plantagenets following the loss of Anjou; 
> - and the Houses of Lancaster and York, two of the Plantagenets' cadet branches. 
> The family held the English throne from 1154, with the accession of Henry II, 
> until 1485, when Richard III died in battle.
>
> England was transformed under the Plantagenets, although only partly intentionally. 
> The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as Magna Carta, 
> which constrained royal power in return for financial and military support. 
> The king was no longer just the most powerful man in the nation, 
> holding the prerogative of judgement, feudal tribute and warfare, 
> but had defined duties to the realm, underpinned by a sophisticated justice system. 
> 
> By the end of the reign of Edward III, the Plantagenets developed a new identity 
> including adopting the language of the ordinary people—Middle English—as the language of governance. 
> This is one of the reasons that the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 
> considers Edward III as culturally the first English Plantagenet ruler.
>
> In the 15th century, the Plantagenets were defeated in the Hundred Years' War 
> and beset with social, political and economic problems. 
> 
> Popular revolts were commonplace, triggered by the denial of numerous freedoms. 
> English nobles raised private armies, engaged in private feuds and openly defied Henry VI. 
> 
> The rivalry between the House of Plantagenet's two cadet branches of York and Lancaster 
> brought about the Wars of the Roses, a decades-long fight for the English succession. 
> 
> It culminated in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, when the reign of the Plantagenets 
> and the English Middle Ages both met their end with the death of King Richard III. 
> 
> Henry VII, a Lancastrian, became king of England; five months later he married Elizabeth of York, 
> thus ending the Wars of the Roses and giving rise to the Tudor dynasty. 
> 
> The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power, 
> which allowed them to avoid some of the problems that had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers. 
> The resulting stability allowed for the English Renaissance and the advent of early modern Britain. 
> 
> Every monarch of England, and later the United Kingdom, from Henry VII to present has been a descendant of the Plantagenets.
