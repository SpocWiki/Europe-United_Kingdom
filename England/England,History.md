> The territory today known as England became inhabited more than 800,000 years ago, 
> as the discovery of stone tools and footprints at Happisburgh in Norfolk have indicated. 
> 
> The earliest evidence for early modern humans in Northwestern Europe, 
> a jawbone discovered in Devon at Kents Cavern in 1927, 
> was re-dated in 2011 to between 41,000 and 44,000 years old. 
> 
> Continuous human habitation in England dates to around 13,000 years ago (see Creswellian), 
> at the end of the Last Glacial Period. 
> The region has numerous remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age, 
> such as Stonehenge and Avebury. 
> 
> In the Iron Age, all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth 
> was inhabited by the Celtic people known as the Britons, 
> including some Belgic tribes (e.g. the Atrebates, the Catuvellauni, the Trinovantes, etc.) 
> in the south east. 
> 
> In AD 43 the Roman conquest of Britain began; 
> the Romans maintained control of their province of Britannia until the early 5th century.
>
> The end of Roman rule in Britain facilitated the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, 
> which historians often regard as the origin of England and of the English people. 
> 
> The Anglo-Saxons, a collection of various Germanic peoples, 
> established several kingdoms that became the primary powers in present-day England 
> and parts of southern Scotland. 
> 
> They introduced the Old English language, which largely displaced the previous Brittonic language. 
> The Anglo-Saxons warred with British successor states in western Britain 
> and the Hen Ogledd (Old North; the Brittonic-speaking parts of northern Britain), 
> as well as with each other. 
> 
> Raids by Vikings became frequent after about AD 800, 
> and the Norsemen settled in large parts of what is now England. 
> During this period, several rulers attempted to unite the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, 
> an effort that led to the emergence of the Kingdom of England by the 10th century.
>
> In 1066, a Norman expedition invaded and conquered England. 
> The Norman dynasty, established by William the Conqueror, ruled England for over half a century 
> before the period of succession crisis known as the Anarchy (1135–1154). 
> 
> Following the Anarchy, England came under the rule of the House of Plantagenet, 
> a dynasty which later inherited claims to the Kingdom of France. 
> During this period, Magna Carta was signed and Parliament became established. 
> 
> Anti-Semitism rose to great heights, 
> and in 1290, England became the first country to permanently expel the Jews. 
> A succession crisis in France led to the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), 
> a series of conflicts involving the peoples of both nations. 
> 
> Following the Hundred Years' Wars, England became embroiled in its own succession wars 
> between the descendants of Edward III's five sons. 
> 
> The Wars of the Roses broke out in 1455 
> and pitted the descendants of the second son (through a female line) Lionel of Antwerp 
> known as the House of York against the House of Lancaster 
> who descended from the third son John of Gaunt and his son Henry IV, 
> the latter of whom had overthrown his cousin Richard II 
> (the only surviving son of Edward III's eldest son Edward the Black Prince) in 1399. 
> 
> In 1485, the war ended when Lancastrian Henry Tudor emerged victorious 
> from the Battle of Bosworth Field and married the senior female Yorkist descendant, 
> Elizabeth of York, uniting the two houses.
>
> Under the Tudors and the later Stuart dynasty, England became a colonial power. 
> During the rule of the Stuarts, the English Civil War took place 
> between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists, 
> which resulted in the execution of King Charles I (1649) 
> and the establishment of a series of republican governments—
> - first, a Parliamentary republic known as the Commonwealth of England (1649–1653), 
> - then a military dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell known as the Protectorate (1653–1659). 
> 
> The Stuarts returned to the restored throne in 1660, 
> though continued questions over religion and power 
> resulted in the deposition of another Stuart king, James II, in the Glorious Revolution (1688). 
> 
> England, which had subsumed Wales in the 16th century under Henry VIII, 
> united with Scotland in 1707 to form a new sovereign state called Great Britain. 
> 
> Following the Industrial Revolution, which started in England, 
> Great Britain ruled a colonial Empire, the largest in recorded history. 
> 
> Following a process of decolonisation in the 20th century, 
> mainly caused by the weakening of Great Britain's power in the two World Wars; 
> almost all of the empire's overseas territories became independent countries.
