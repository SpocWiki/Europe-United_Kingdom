## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The name "London Bridge" refers to several historic crossings 
> that have spanned the River Thames between the City of London and Southwark in central London since Roman times. 
> 
> The current crossing, which opened to traffic in 1973, 
> is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel. 
> 
> It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, 
> which in turn superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. 
> 
> In addition to the roadway, for much of its history, 
> the broad medieval bridge supported an extensive built up area of homes and businesses, 
> part of the City's Bridge ward, and its southern end in Southwark 
> was guarded by a large stone City gateway. 
> 
> The medieval bridge was preceded by a succession of timber bridges, 
> the first of which was built by the Roman founders of London (Londinium) around AD 50.
>
> The current bridge stands at the western end of the Pool of London 
> and is positioned 30 metres (98 ft) upstream from previous alignments. 
> 
> The approaches to the medieval bridge were marked by 
> the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr on the northern bank 
> and by Southwark Cathedral on the southern shore. 
> 
> Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729, London Bridge was the only road crossing of the Thames 
> downstream of Kingston upon Thames. 
> 
> London Bridge has been depicted in its several forms, in art, literature, and songs, 
> including the nursery rhyme "London Bridge Is Falling Down", 
> and the epic poem The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot.
>
> The modern bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, 
> an independent charity of medieval origin overseen by the City of London Corporation. 
> It carries the A3 road, which is maintained by the Greater London Authority. 
> 
> The crossing also delineates an area along the southern bank of the River Thames, 
> between London Bridge and Tower Bridge, 
> that has been designated as a business improvement district.
