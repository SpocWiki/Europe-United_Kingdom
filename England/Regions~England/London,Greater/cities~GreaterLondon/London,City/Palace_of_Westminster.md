> The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the Parliament of the United Kingdom 
> and is located in London, England. 
> 
> It is commonly called the Houses of Parliament 
> after the House of Commons and the House of Lords, 
> the two legislative chambers which occupy the building. 
> 
> The palace is one of the centres of political life in the United Kingdom; 
> "Westminster" has become a metonym for the UK Parliament and the British Government, 
> and the Westminster system of government commemorates the name of the palace. 
> 
> The Elizabeth Tower of the palace, nicknamed Big Ben, 
> is a landmark of London and the United Kingdom in general. 
> The palace has been a Grade I listed building since 1970 
> and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.
>
> The building was originally constructed in the eleventh century as a royal palace 
> and was the primary residence of the kings of England 
> until 1512, when a fire destroyed the royal apartments. 
> 
> The monarch moved to the adjacent Palace of Whitehall, 
> but the remainder of the palace continued to serve as the home of the Parliament of England, 
> which had met there since the 13th century. 
> In 1834 a second, larger fire destroyed the majority of the palace, 
> but the twelfth century Westminster Hall was saved and incorporated into the replacement building.
>
> The competition to design the new palace was won by the architect Charles Barry, 
> who chose a Gothic Revival style for the building. 
> Construction started in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, suffering delays, cost overruns, 
> and the deaths of Barry and his assistant, Augustus Pugin. 
> 
> This new palace became globally famous for its ornate decoration, 
> and contributed to the proliferation of Gothic Revival architecture around the world. 
> 
> The palace contains chambers for the House of Commons, House of Lords, and the monarch, 
> and has a floor area of 1,210,680 sq ft (112,476 m2). 
> 
> Extensive repairs had to be made after the Second World War, 
> including rebuilding the destroyed Commons chamber. 
> 
> Despite further conservation work having been carried out since, 
> the palace is in urgent need of major repairs.
