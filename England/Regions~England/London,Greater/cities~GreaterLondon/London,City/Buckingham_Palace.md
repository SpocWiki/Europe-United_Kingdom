> Buckingham Palace (UK: ) is a royal residence in London, 
> and the administrative headquarters of the monarch of the United Kingdom. 
> Located in the City of Westminster, 
> the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. 
> It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.
>
> Originally known as Buckingham House, 
> the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse 
> built for the Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703 
> on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. 
> 
> It was acquired by George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte 
> and became known as The Queen's House. 
> During the 19th century it was enlarged by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, 
> who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. 
> Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch 
> on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.
>
> The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, 
> including the East Front, which contains the balcony 
> on which the royal family traditionally appears to greet crowds. 
> 
> A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during the Second World War; 
> the King's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 
> to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection.
>
> The original early-19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, 
> include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, 
> on the advice of Charles Long. 
> 
> King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle Ã‰poque cream and gold colour scheme. 
> Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style 
> with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House. 
> 
> The palace has 775 rooms, and the garden is the largest private garden in London. 
> The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, 
> are open to the public each year for most of August and September 
> and on some days in winter and spring.
