## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Natural History Museum in London is a museum 
> that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. 
> 
> It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, 
> the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. 
> The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road.
>
> The museum is home to life and earth science specimens 
> comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: 
> - botany, 
> - entomology, 
> - mineralogy, 
> - palaeontology and 
> - zoology. 
> 
> The museum is a centre of research 
> specialising in taxonomy, identification and conservation. 
> 
> Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical 
> as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin. 
> 
> The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons 
> and ornate architecture—sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature—
> both exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast that dominated the vaulted central hall 
> before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale 
> hanging from the ceiling. 
> 
> The Natural History Museum Library contains an extensive collection of 
> books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork 
> linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; 
> access to the library is by appointment only. 
> 
> The museum is recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history 
> and research of related fields in the world.
>
> Although commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, 
> it was officially known as British Museum (Natural History) until 1992, 
> despite legal separation from the British Museum itself in 1963. 
> 
> Originating from collections within the British Museum, 
> the landmark Alfred Waterhouse building was built and opened by 1881 
> and later incorporated the Geological Museum. 
> 
> The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, 
> partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections.
>
> Like other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, 
> the Natural History Museum does not charge an admission fee.
>
> The museum is an exempt charity and a non-departmental public body 
> sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. 
> 
> The Princess of Wales is a patron of the museum. 
> There are approximately 850 staff at the museum. 
> 
> The two largest strategic groups are the Public Engagement Group and the Science Group.
