The borough is centred around the town of Bury but also includes the other towns of Ramsbottom, Tottington, Radcliffe, Whitefield and Prestwich.

> Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, which covers 99 square kilometres (38 sq mi), was created on 1 April 1974, with the transfer of functions from the County Borough of Bury and the boroughs of Prestwich and Radcliffe, along with the urban districts of Tottington and Whitefield, and part of the urban district of Ramsbottom, all previously in Lancashire.
