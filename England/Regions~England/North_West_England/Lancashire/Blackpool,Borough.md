## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Borough of Blackpool is a unitary authority area with borough status 
> in the ceremonial county of Lancashire, North West England. 
> It is named after the seaside town of Blackpool 
> but covers a wider area which includes Anchorsholme, Bispham, Layton, Marton 
> and Squires Gate, as well as the suburbs of Grange Park, North Shore, South Shore and Starr Gate. 
> The borough also forms the core of the wider Blackpool conurbation.
>
> The borough is bordered to the north and north-east by the Borough of Wyre 
> (including Fleetwood, Cleveleys, Thornton and Poulton-le-Fylde), 
> and to the south and south-east by Borough of Fylde (including Lytham St Annes), 
> both of which are non-metropolitan districts in Lancashire. 
> The western boundary is the Irish Sea coast. 
> Surrounding districts form part of the Blackpool Urban Area 
> which covers all the unitary authority area.
