> Part of Yorkshire since before Domesday Book, Middlesbrough became a town with a municipal borough in 1853. When Yorkshire was split into its ancient ridings for administrative purposes in 1889, Middlesbrough was large enough to become a county borough, independent of the then new North Riding County Council. In 1968 the Borough of Middlesbrough was merged into the County Borough of Teesside. In 1974 the eponymous Borough of Middlesbrough was established within the new county of Cleveland. The new county was abolished in 1996 and since then the town's borough has had unitary authority status within the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire. Since 2016 the borough has had a representative seat on the Tees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA).
